{"id":"C1","cat":"gap","sev":"critical","q":"Plan 03-02 lists 10 agent files in fm but only covers reviewing agents -- what about Critic, Scout, Debugger, Security, and Tester for review ownership language?","ctx":"REQ-06 says 'all agent prompts include review ownership language' but plan 03-02 only targets Senior, Lead, Owner, Architect, QA, QA-Code, and their FE/UX variants. Critic reviews requirements, Scout reviews research quality, Debugger reviews evidence. Tester implicitly reviews Senior's ts field. Security reviews code against standards. These 5 agents also perform review activities. Success criteria says 'All agent prompts include review ownership language patterns'.","sug":"Clarify whether REQ-06 applies to ALL 26 agents or only agents in explicit reviewer roles. If all 26, add tasks for Critic, Scout, Debugger, Security, and Tester. If not, update success criterion to 'All reviewing agent prompts'.","st":"open","reqs":["REQ-06"]}
{"id":"C2","cat":"gap","sev":"major","q":"No explicit test strategy for Phase 3 -- how will these documentation/prompt changes be verified beyond the audit checklist?","ctx":"Phase 3 is entirely documentation changes. Plan 03-04 T5 runs the audit checklist, but there are no automated BATS tests. Existing static tests could be extended to verify new sections exist in agent prompts. Without tests, regression is possible.","sug":"Add BATS tests that grep agent files for required sections (Review Ownership Language, Change Management). Aligns with static test category.","st":"open","reqs":["REQ-05","REQ-06"]}

File-overlap detection would serialize them, but td field should make sequential dependency explicit.","sug":"Add td: T2 depends on T1, T3 depends on T2. Or consolidate into single task.","st":"open","reqs":["REQ-05"]}

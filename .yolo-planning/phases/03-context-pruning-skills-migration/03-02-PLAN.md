# Plan 02: Migrate Discussion-Engine and Verification-Protocol to Skills

## Background

Two more protocol references are candidates for skill migration:
- `references/discussion-engine.md` (176 lines) -- loaded only by vibe.md Discuss mode and discuss.md
- `references/verification-protocol.md` (165 lines) -- loaded conceptually by verification flow

Together with execute-protocol (Plan 01), these 3 migrations satisfy the "at least 3 protocol references converted to skills" success criterion.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create skill directories

**Description:** Create `skills/discussion-engine/` and `skills/verification-protocol/` directories.

**Files:**
- `skills/discussion-engine/` (new directory)
- `skills/verification-protocol/` (new directory)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Both directories exist

### Task 2: Migrate discussion-engine to skill

**Description:** Move `references/discussion-engine.md` content into `skills/discussion-engine/SKILL.md` with SKILL.md frontmatter (name, description). Replace original with a thin redirect stub pointing to the skill location.

**Files:**
- `skills/discussion-engine/SKILL.md` (new)
- `references/discussion-engine.md` (modify to redirect stub)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `skills/discussion-engine/SKILL.md` contains full discussion engine protocol with frontmatter
- `references/discussion-engine.md` is a 3-5 line redirect stub
- No content loss

### Task 3: Migrate verification-protocol to skill

**Description:** Move `references/verification-protocol.md` content into `skills/verification-protocol/SKILL.md` with SKILL.md frontmatter. Replace original with redirect stub.

**Files:**
- `skills/verification-protocol/SKILL.md` (new)
- `references/verification-protocol.md` (modify to redirect stub)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `skills/verification-protocol/SKILL.md` contains full verification protocol with frontmatter
- `references/verification-protocol.md` is a 3-5 line redirect stub
- No content loss

### Task 4: Update all command references to new skill paths

**Description:** Update commands that reference the migrated protocols:
- `commands/vibe.md` line 131 and 186: `references/discussion-engine.md` -> `skills/discussion-engine/SKILL.md`
- `commands/discuss.md` line 34: `references/discussion-engine.md` -> `skills/discussion-engine/SKILL.md`
- Any references to `verification-protocol.md` in commands (verify.md loads verification logic from summaries, not a direct `@` reference, so this may be minimal)

**Files:**
- `commands/vibe.md` (modify discussion-engine references only -- do NOT touch Execute mode, that's Plan 01)
- `commands/discuss.md` (modify discussion-engine reference)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- All `references/discussion-engine.md` references in commands updated to `skills/discussion-engine/SKILL.md`
- All `references/verification-protocol.md` references in commands updated to `skills/verification-protocol/SKILL.md`
- No references to old paths remain in commands/ for these two protocols

{"ts":"2026-02-16T00:00:00Z","agent":"lead","task":"01-01","dec":"Single plan with 5 tasks all targeting execute-protocol.md","reason":"All changes are to one file in distinct sections -- a new protocol section, steps 1-5, steps 6-10, the transitions table, and skip documentation. Single plan avoids cross-plan coordination overhead while keeping tasks atomic.","alts":["Two plans: one for gate pattern + table, one for per-step changes","Three plans: pattern, steps, skip docs"]}
{"ts":"2026-02-16T00:00:00Z","agent":"lead","task":"01-01","dec":"Task 1 defines the gate pattern template before Tasks 2-3 apply it to individual steps","reason":"Establishes a reusable pattern (ENTRY GATE / EXIT GATE blocks) that Tasks 2-3 repeat for each step. Senior can reference T1's pattern in T2/T3 specs without duplication.","alts":["Inline the pattern definition in each step modification task"]}
{"ts":"2026-02-16T00:00:00Z","agent":"lead","task":"01-01","dec":"Split per-step gates into two tasks (T2: Steps 1-5, T3: Steps 6-10) rather than one task for all 10","reason":"Each task should be one commit. Steps 1-5 and 6-10 are natural groupings -- pre-implementation vs post-implementation. Keeps each commit reviewable.","alts":["Single task for all 10 steps","One task per step (10 tasks, exceeds 3-5 limit)"]}
{"ts":"2026-02-16T00:00:00Z","agent":"senior","task":"T1","dec":"Use steps object in execution-state.json keyed by step_name with status/timestamp/artifact/reason fields","reason":"Enables both entry gates (check predecessor step status for skip-or-artifact) and exit gates (update current step) via jq queries on a single JSON object. Aligns with existing execution-state.json schema pattern in Step 3.","alts":["Flat array of step entries","Separate status file per step"]}
{"ts":"2026-02-16T00:00:00Z","agent":"senior","task":"T2-T3","dec":"Entry gates check artifact existence OR predecessor step skipped status, not both required","reason":"When a skippable step is skipped, its artifact does not exist. The entry gate for the next step must accept either the artifact OR the skipped status as valid. This OR-logic is critical for turbo effort where steps 1, 5, 8, 9 may all be skipped.","alts":["Require artifact always (breaks skip flows)","Skip entry gate when predecessor was skipped (loses enforcement)"]}
{"ts":"2026-02-16T00:00:00Z","agent":"senior","task":"T4","dec":"Include both the per-step transitions table and the full execution-state.json schema in the same section","reason":"Keeps the enforcement contract and the data model co-located. Dev implementing go.md can reference one section for both what to check and where to store the result.","alts":["Schema in artifact-formats.md only","Schema inline in Step 3 only"]}
{"ts":"2026-02-16T00:00:00Z","agent":"senior","task":"T5","dec":"Classify Step 2 (Architecture) as skippable since it has a guard condition for existing architecture.toon","reason":"The existing Guard on Step 2 allows skip when architecture.toon exists. This is the same pattern as Step 1 (skip when critique.jsonl exists). T5 must document this as a skippable step for completeness.","alts":["Classify Step 2 as mandatory (would require removing its existing guard)"]}
{"ts":"2026-02-16T00:00:00Z","agent":"senior","task":"T5","dec":"No ts fields for any task since all changes are documentation-only Markdown edits","reason":"All 5 tasks modify references/execute-protocol.md with text insertions and replacements. There is no executable code to test. Verification is via grep counts specified in each spec.","alts":["Write tests that grep for expected patterns (over-engineering for doc changes)"]}

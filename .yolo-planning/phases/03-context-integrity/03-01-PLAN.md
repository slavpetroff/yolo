title: "ARCHITECTURE.md in execution family tier2 context"
wave: 1
depends_on: []
must_haves:
  - Execution family tier2_files returns ARCHITECTURE.md and ROADMAP.md
  - Dev/QA/Debugger compiled context includes ARCHITECTURE.md content
  - All existing tier_context tests pass with updated assertions

## Task 1: Add ARCHITECTURE.md to execution family and update tests

**Files:** `yolo-mcp-server/src/commands/tier_context.rs`

Change `tier2_files()` at line 84 to return `vec!["ARCHITECTURE.md", "ROADMAP.md"]` for the `"execution"` match arm.

Update test assertions:
1. `test_tier2_files_by_family` (line 481-482): Change expected execution vec to `["ARCHITECTURE.md", "ROADMAP.md"]`
2. `test_tier2_different_families_differ` (line 534): Flip `assert!(!t2_dev.contains("Architecture overview"))` to `assert!(t2_dev.contains("Architecture overview"))`
3. Verify `assert_ne!(t2_dev, t2_lead)` at line 530 still holds (planning has REQUIREMENTS.md, execution does not — content should still differ)

Run `cargo test` in `yolo-mcp-server/` to verify all tests pass.

**Commit:** `feat(rust): add ARCHITECTURE.md to execution family tier2 context`

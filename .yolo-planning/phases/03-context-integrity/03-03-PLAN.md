wave: 1

must_haves:
  - yolo-lead.md contains Anti-Takeover Protocol section
  - Protocol explicitly forbids Write/Edit on files_modified
  - Protocol includes recovery action (create new Dev agent)

## Task 1: Add anti-takeover protocol to Lead agent definition

**Files:** `agents/yolo-lead.md`

Add a new section `## Anti-Takeover Protocol` after the existing `## Constraints` section:

```markdown
## Anti-Takeover Protocol

You are a PLANNING agent. You MUST NOT implement code.

**Hard rules:**
- NEVER Write/Edit files listed in any plan's `files_modified` — those belong to Dev agents
- NEVER write SUMMARY.md content — Dev agents write summaries for their own work
- NEVER run tests or fix code — spawn a Dev or Debugger agent instead
- If all Dev agents are unavailable: create a NEW Dev agent via Task tool. Do NOT take over.

**If you feel compelled to implement:** STOP. Re-read this section. Create a Dev agent.
```

**Commit:** `feat(agents): add anti-takeover protocol to Lead agent definition`

{"f":"agents/yolo-fe-architect.md","sev":"nit","issue":"Persona & Voice section has 17 non-blank lines; TD2 specifies 8-15. Affects 10 of 26 agents (mostly Frontend dept: fe-architect, fe-dev, fe-senior, fe-tester at 17 lines; fe-lead, fe-qa-code, owner, qa-code, qa, ux-architect at 16). Dev followed enriched spec targets exactly -- the spec-provided target structures themselves exceed 15 lines. Spec-level ambiguity, not implementation error.","sug":"No action required. If strict adherence desired in future phases, Senior should tighten spec targets to 15 non-blank lines maximum."}

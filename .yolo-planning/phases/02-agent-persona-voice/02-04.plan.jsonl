Never hardcode paths.\n- The all_agents array must list exactly 26 agents: 7 backend + 5 shared + 7 frontend + 7 UX.\n- sed pattern '/^## Persona & Voice$/,/^## /' extracts the section between headings. Use this for content checks (checks 2, 4, 5).\n- For check 3 (no old heading), grep the ENTIRE file, not just the section -- ensures no stale heading anywhere.\n- For check 5 (no example phrases), check section content only (the section extracted by sed). Other sections may legitimately contain quoted examples.\n- The td dependency on T1, T2, T3 ensures all UX agents have the section before tests run. Backend (02-01), shared (02-02), and frontend (02-03) agents are handled by other plans with wave dependencies.\n- Commit as single file, single commit: test(02-04): static validation for Persona & Voice sections"}

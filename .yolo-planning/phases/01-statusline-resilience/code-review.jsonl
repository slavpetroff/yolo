{"plan":"01-01","r":"approve","spec_compliance":"full","notes":"statusline-utils.sh (188 lines) implements all 6 functions per spec. TD1 CSI regex uses [a-zA-Z] final byte. TD2 strip_osc8_links handles both ESC\\ and BEL terminators (improvement over spec). TD3 truncate_line awk parser enhanced with UTF-8 multi-byte awareness, semantic in_link tracking, and saw_esc guard. TD5 no side effects confirmed. TD6 MAX_WIDTH=YOLO_MAX_WIDTH:-120 correct. printf %b interpretation in truncate_line correctly converts \\033 literals to real ESC bytes before measuring. LC_ALL=C applied consistently for BSD/macOS portability."}
{"plan":"01-02","r":"approve","spec_compliance":"full","notes":"yolo-statusline.sh (623 lines) correctly integrates all width budget mechanisms. Source statement at line 12 after color defs. C8 degradation order comment block present. L3 two-pass construction per TD4 with skeleton/rebuild pattern, segment dropping loop, and fallback. L1 rebuild-based budget with progressive segment dropping (Diff->Commits->Files->QA). L2 bar shrinking (20->12->8) then label abbreviation. L4 progressive degradation (update->agents->versions). Safety-net truncate_line uses printf %s (not %b) to avoid double-interpretation — correct deviation from spec. Unicode separators preserved throughout."}
{"plan":"01-03","r":"approve","spec_compliance":"full","notes":"yolo-statusline.bats (471 lines, 31 tests). All 8 existing tests unchanged. 23 new tests cover: visible_width (5 tests including non-m CSI per C1), strip_osc8_links (1), strip_ansi (1), truncate_line (5 including empty/custom-width/reset-on-truncation), compute_bar_width (3 including drop signal), L3 integration (2 including YOLO_MAX_WIDTH=80), L1 integration (2 including execution mode), L2 integration (1), L4 integration (2 including YOLO_MAX_WIDTH=70), all-lines simultaneous (1). Slow cache seeding helpers correctly construct cache paths with VERSION and -ok sentinel."}

# Plan 03: Version Bump, CHANGELOG, Tag, and GitHub Release

## Goal

Bump the version to 2.5.0 (minor bump -- README rewrite and VBW cleanup are user-facing changes), update CHANGELOG, create git tag, and publish GitHub release. This plan depends on Plans 01 and 02 being complete.

## Rationale for minor bump (2.4.0 -> 2.5.0)

The README rewrite is a significant user-facing change: new structure, updated metrics, trimmed content. Combined with VBW remnant removal, this warrants a minor version bump rather than a patch.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Bump version across all version files

**Files:** `VERSION`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `marketplace.json`, `Cargo.toml`

Update version from 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 in these 5 files:

1. `VERSION`: Change `2.4.0` to `2.5.0`
2. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: Change `"version": "2.4.0"` to `"version": "2.5.0"`
3. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: Change `"version": "2.4.0"` to `"version": "2.5.0"`
4. `marketplace.json`: Change `"version": "2.4.0"` to `"version": "2.5.0"`
5. `Cargo.toml`: Change `version = "2.3.1"` to `version = "2.5.0"` (sync with main version)

### Task 2: Update CHANGELOG with Phase 5 changes

**Files:** `CHANGELOG.md`

Add a new `[2.5.0]` entry at the top of the changelog (above `[2.4.0]`), dated today (2026-02-22):

```markdown
## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- **`readme`** -- README rewritten for conciseness: restructured for quick-start-first layout, verbose sections trimmed, stale metrics updated. Reduced from 996 to ~650 lines.
- **`plugin-isolation`** -- Rewritten for YOLO-only context, removed retired VBW/GSD dual-plugin references.
- **`claude-md`** -- Removed VBW-specific rule, updated Active Context to reflect current state.

### Removed

- **`vbw-remnants`** -- All VBW (Vibe Better With) plugin references removed from active code files (CLAUDE.md, plugin-isolation.md).
```

Adjust the line count and specific details based on what Plans 01 and 02 actually changed.

### Task 3: Create git tag and GitHub release

**Files:** none (git and gh operations only)

1. Stage all changed files from Tasks 1 and 2
2. Commit with message: `chore: bump version to v2.5.0`
3. Create annotated git tag: `git tag -a v2.5.0 -m "v2.5.0: Release prep and README rewrite"`
4. Push commit and tag: `git push && git push --tags`
5. Create GitHub release: `gh release create v2.5.0 --title "v2.5.0" --notes-file -` (pipe the CHANGELOG section as notes)

**IMPORTANT:** Only execute the push and release steps if the user has explicitly requested pushing. If not, create the tag locally and report that push is pending user approval.

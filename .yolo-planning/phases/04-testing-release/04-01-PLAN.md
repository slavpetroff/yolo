# Plan 04-01: Documentation updates and version bump

## Context
Phases 1-3 implemented feedback loop infrastructure, review loop orchestration, and QA loop
orchestration. The docs (README, CHANGELOG) don't mention feedback loops yet, and the version
is still 2.6.0. This plan updates documentation and bumps the version for release.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add Feedback Loops section to README.md
Read `README.md`. Add a new "Feedback Loops" section after the existing "Features" section
(before "Design Decisions"). Content should cover:

- **Review Gate Loop** (Step 2b): When `review_gate` is active, plans are reviewed before execution.
  On reject, the Architect automatically revises the plan and the Reviewer re-reviews. Loops until
  approve/conditional or `review_max_cycles` (default 3) exceeded. Hard stop on max cycles.
- **QA Gate Loop** (Step 3d): When `qa_gate` is active, completed work is verified by 5 QA checks.
  On failure, failures categorized by `fixable_by`. Dev-fixable issues trigger scoped auto-remediation.
  Architect/manual issues cause immediate hard stop. Loops until all pass or `qa_max_cycles` exceeded.
- **Configuration**: `review_gate`, `qa_gate` (always/on_request/never), `review_max_cycles`,
  `qa_max_cycles` (default 3, range 1-5)
- **Cache efficiency**: Review loop agents share "planning" Tier 2 cache. QA loop agents share
  "execution" Tier 2 cache. Loops stay warm — no recompilation between iterations.

Keep it concise (30-50 lines). Match the existing README style and formatting.

**File:** `README.md`
**Commit:** `docs(04-01): add Feedback Loops section to README`

### Task 2: Update CHANGELOG.md with v2.7.0 entry
Read `CHANGELOG.md`. Add a v2.7.0 entry at the top following the existing format. Include:

- **Review Feedback Loop**: Automated Architect ↔ Reviewer loop on plan rejection, delta-findings
  passing, per-plan loop independence, configurable hard cap
- **QA Feedback Loop**: Automated Dev ↔ QA remediation loop, fixable_by classification routing,
  scoped Dev remediation context, delta re-runs (only failed checks)
- **Infrastructure**: `review_max_cycles`/`qa_max_cycles` config keys, `suggested_fix`/`auto_fixable`
  on review findings, `fixable_by` on all QA commands, 6 loop event types
- **Agent Updates**: Architect revision protocol, Reviewer delta-aware review + escalation,
  QA agent remediation classification

**File:** `CHANGELOG.md`
**Commit:** `docs(04-01): add v2.7.0 changelog entry`

### Task 3: Bump version to 2.7.0
Update version in all three locations:
- `VERSION` file: `2.6.0` → `2.7.0`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: version field `2.6.0` → `2.7.0`
- `yolo-mcp-server/Cargo.toml`: version field `2.6.0` → `2.7.0`

Also check if there's a `marketplace.json` or `STACK.md` with version references and update those.

**Files:** `VERSION`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `yolo-mcp-server/Cargo.toml`
**Commit:** `chore(04-01): bump version to v2.7.0`

### Task 4: Run existing tests to verify no regressions
Run the existing Rust tests and bats tests to ensure documentation and version changes
haven't broken anything:

```bash
cd yolo-mcp-server && cargo test 2>&1 | tail -5
bats tests/qa-commands.bats tests/review-plan.bats
```

If any tests fail, fix them. If all pass, this task produces no commit.

**File:** verification only
**Commit:** `fix(04-01): resolve test regressions` (only if fixes needed)

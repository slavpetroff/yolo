Protocol docs (go.md, execute-protocol.md, cross-team-protocol.md) expanded with full Phase 2 agent rosters. handoff-schemas.md Tester->Senior fix applied (C3). ROADMAP.md criteria corrected (C2). 27 new tests (8 static + 9 unit + 10 integration) all GREEN. Full regression 932 tests, 0 failures. TDD RED phase commit cb3d662 precedes GREEN implementation for 02-02 T3 (12 tests). One justified deviation in 02-04 T1: spec said owner excluded from @reference check, but 02-02 T2 spec included the @reference in owner -- Dev resolved correctly by checking all 23."}

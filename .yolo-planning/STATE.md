|-------|--------|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Complete | 2 | 8 | 6 |

## Key Decisions
| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| MCP hybrid (keep server) | 2026-02-22 | Locking + test suite used via MCP (44+ calls). CLI for orchestration. Document pattern, remove compile_context overlap |
| 3 new agents in existing families | 2026-02-22 | Researcher + Reviewer → "planning" family (Tier 2 cache with Architect/Lead). QA → "execution" family (Tier 2 cache with Dev) |
| Rust-backed quality gates | 2026-02-22 | Reviewer and QA powered by Rust CLI commands, not just LLM instructions. Enforceable, measurable, fast |

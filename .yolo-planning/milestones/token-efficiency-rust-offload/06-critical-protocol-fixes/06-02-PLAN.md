# Plan 02: Fix README and STACK.md Stale Claims

## Goal

Correct four stale or inaccurate claims in README.md and one stale version in STACK.md. All are factual errors that misrepresent the current state of the project.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Fix agent table and count in README.md

**Files:** `README.md`

**Bug:** The agent table (lines 195-209) lists 7 agents including Scout and QA. Neither exists as agent files. Actual agents: architect, debugger, dev, docs, lead, reviewer (6 total).

**Fix:**
1. Line 59: Change "7 specialized agents" to "6 specialized agents". Remove "Scout and QA literally cannot write files" since they don't exist.
2. Line 197: Change heading "7 agents" to "6 agents".
3. Remove the Scout row (line 201) and QA row (line 205) from the agent table.
4. Line 209: Update the Denied explanation — remove references to Scout and QA. Change "4 of 7 agents" to the correct ratio.
5. Line 229 in architecture diagram: Remove the "QA (verification)" line.
6. Line 348: Update "4 of 7 agents" to correct ratio. Remove "Scout and QA cannot write files."
7. Line 595: Change "7 agent definitions" to "6 agent definitions" in project structure.

Also add the Reviewer agent to the table since `yolo-reviewer.md` exists but is not listed.

**Verification:** Grep README.md for "7 agents", "Scout", and "QA" — should find zero matches in active content (aside from `/yolo:qa` command references which are about the command, not the agent). Confirm Reviewer row is present.

### Task 2: Fix hook count claims in README.md

**Files:** `README.md`

**Bug:** README claims "21 hooks across 11 event types" in multiple places. Actual: 11 hook entries in hooks.json routing to ~19 internal Rust handlers across 11 event types.

**Fix:**
1. Line 60: Change "21 hooks across 11 event types" to "11 hook entries routing to ~19 Rust handlers across 11 event types" or simply "19 Rust hook handlers across 11 event types".
2. Line 267: Same fix in the Hook System section header.
3. Line 347: Same fix in the Features section.

Use consistent wording across all three locations.

**Verification:** Grep README.md for "21 hooks" — should find zero matches.

### Task 3: Fix test count in README.md

**Files:** `README.md`

**Bug:** Line 24 says "1,610 tests validate the stack." Actual current count: 671 bats + 953 Rust unit tests = 1,624 tests.

**Fix:** Update line 24 to "1,624 tests validate the stack." (or re-count and use the exact number at time of execution).

**Verification:** Confirm the test count line matches the actual count from `bats --count` + `cargo test` output.

### Task 4: Fix STACK.md version

**Files:** `.yolo-planning/codebase/STACK.md`

**Bug:** Line 33 says "Version: 2.3.0". Actual version is 2.5.0 (per the most recent version bump commit).

**Fix:** Change "Version: 2.3.0" to "Version: 2.5.0".

**Verification:** Read STACK.md and confirm version line says 2.5.0.

# Plan 02: Rewrite README for Conciseness and Performance Showcase

## Goal

Rewrite README.md to be concise and performance-focused. The current 996-line README buries the quick-start guide under lengthy feature descriptions. Restructure to lead with value proposition, quick-start, and performance data. Cut verbose sections without losing information coverage.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Update stale metrics and badges

**Files:** `README.md`

Update these stale values:
- Line 28: "852 tests" -- update to actual count (run grep for `@test` across tests/ to get current number)
- Line 18: Claude Code badge version `v1.0.33+` -- verify current minimum version
- Line 30: Analysis report links -- add v2.4.0 report if it exists in docs/, otherwise note the latest is v1.21.30
- Line 3: Verify model badge says "Opus 4.6+" (correct)

### Task 2: Restructure README for quick-start-first layout

**Files:** `README.md`

Reorganize the README structure so the most actionable content comes first:

**New order:**
1. Title + badges + one-liner value prop (keep existing)
2. Token efficiency table (keep -- this is the hook)
3. What Is This (trim to 3-4 sentences max)
4. Quick Start (move up from current position, trim)
5. Installation (keep, already concise)
6. Commands (keep tables, they are scannable)
7. The Agents (keep table, trim ASCII diagrams)
8. Features (move DOWN -- details for people already interested)
9. Effort Profiles / Autonomy / Planning & Git / Settings / Feature Flags / Cost Optimization (keep but consider collapsing into fewer sections)
10. Project Structure / Requirements / Contributing / License

### Task 3: Trim verbose sections

**Files:** `README.md`

Cut these sections to reduce total line count:

1. **Manifesto** (lines 55-68): Trim to 2-3 sentences. The Discord link stays.
2. **What Is This** (lines 71-83): Cut to 3 sentences max. Remove Reddit joke and "post-dignity era" paragraph.
3. **Features > Built for Opus 4.6+** (lines 115-128): Each bullet is 3-4 lines of explanation. Cut each to 1-2 lines. The detail exists in referenced docs.
4. **Features > Solves Agent Teams limitations** (lines 131-143): Same treatment -- 1-2 lines per bullet.
5. **Features > Skills.sh integration** (lines 147-154): 2 sentences max.
6. **Features > Real-time statusline** (lines 157-162): Keep image, cut text to 1 sentence.
7. **How It Works** ASCII flowchart (lines 248-314): Keep but verify it fits. If over 40 lines, consider simplifying.
8. **Quick Tutorial** (lines 323-396): The `/clear` warning block (lines 388-394) is 7 lines -- keep but trim. The advanced users note (line 396) stays.
9. **Agent permission model ASCII art** (lines 534-547): Remove -- the table above it conveys the same information.
10. **Settings Reference** (lines 660-744): Keep tables, remove prose explanations that repeat what the table says. Each setting needs only its table row.
11. **Feature Flags Reference** (lines 752-813): Each flag has 3-5 lines of explanation. Cut to 1-2 lines each. Move implementation details to a separate doc if needed.

### Task 4: Add "What You Get" summary after token table

**Files:** `README.md`

After the token efficiency table, add a concise "What You Get" block (6-8 lines max) that summarizes the practical difference for a new user:

- One command (`/yolo:vibe`) handles the entire lifecycle
- 7 specialized agents with platform-enforced permissions
- 21 hooks for continuous verification
- Atomic commits per task
- Session persistence across compaction and terminal restarts
- 4 effort profiles from Turbo (just build) to Thorough (full review)

This replaces the long Features section as the primary value communication. The Features section becomes supplementary detail.

### Task 5: Final line count verification

**Files:** `README.md`

Verify the final README is under 700 lines. If over, identify the largest remaining section and trim further. Ensure all internal anchor links in the Table of Contents still resolve to valid headings.

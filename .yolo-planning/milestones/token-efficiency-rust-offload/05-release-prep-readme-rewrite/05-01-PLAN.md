# Plan 01: Clean VBW Remnants from Active Code

## Goal

Remove all VBW (Vibe Better With) remnants from the two active code files that still reference the retired VBW plugin system. Update CLAUDE.md Active Context to reflect current project state.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Remove VBW rule from CLAUDE.md

**Files:** `CLAUDE.md`

Remove line 17 (`- **VBW-specific:** Use VBW commands for project work. Do not manually edit `.vbw-planning/`.`) entirely. This rule references a retired plugin system that no longer exists.

Also update the Active Context section:
- Change `**Work:**` to reflect Phase 5 is the current phase
- Update `**Last shipped:**` with correct info (CLI Intelligence & Token Optimization phases 1-4)
- Change `**Next action:**` to indicate Phase 5 release prep is in progress

### Task 2: Rewrite plugin-isolation.md for YOLO-only

**Files:** `references/plugin-isolation.md`

The current file references VBW isolation from GSD (Get Shit Done), which is a retired dual-plugin scenario. Rewrite to be YOLO-only:

1. Remove all `.vbw-planning/` references
2. Remove all GSD references and cross-plugin isolation rules
3. Keep the file focused on YOLO's own isolation boundaries:
   - `.yolo-planning/` directory is the planning artifact boundary
   - Agents respect their tool permissions (enforced by platform)
   - Planning artifacts are separate from source code
   - Hook-enforced file boundaries (file-guard, security-filter)
4. Keep it concise -- under 20 lines

### Task 3: Verify no remaining VBW references in modified files

**Files:** none (verification only)

Run a grep across CLAUDE.md and references/plugin-isolation.md to confirm zero remaining occurrences of "VBW", "vbw", ".vbw-planning", or "GSD". Report the verification result in the commit message.

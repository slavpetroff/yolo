# Plan 02: Version Bump, CHANGELOG, and Test Verification

## Goal

Bump version to 2.6.0, update CHANGELOG with Phase 1-4 additions, and verify all tests pass.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Bump version to 2.6.0

**Files:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `yolo-mcp-server/Cargo.toml`, `.yolo-planning/codebase/STACK.md`

**Read each file first. Update version from 2.5.0 to 2.6.0.**

Also run: `yolo bump-version 2.6.0` if the command exists (it may handle version files automatically). If not, update manually:

1. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — `"version": "2.6.0"`
2. `yolo-mcp-server/Cargo.toml` — `version = "2.6.0"`
3. `.yolo-planning/codebase/STACK.md` — `Version: 2.6.0`

**Verification:** `grep -r "2.6.0" .claude-plugin/plugin.json yolo-mcp-server/Cargo.toml` shows 2 matches.

### Task 2: Update CHANGELOG.md

**Files:** `CHANGELOG.md`

**Read CHANGELOG.md first.** Add a new v2.6.0 entry at the top (after any header), before the v2.5.0 entry.

**Entry content:**
```markdown
## v2.6.0 (2026-02-23)

### New Agents
- **Researcher** — Internet research agent with WebSearch/WebFetch, writes structured RESEARCH.md findings
- **Reviewer** — Adversarial design critic, serves as quality gate between planning and execution
- **QA** — Delivery verification agent, validates code delivery against plans using 5 Rust commands

### New Rust Commands
- `review-plan` — Automated plan quality checks (frontmatter, task count, must_haves, wave validity, file paths)
- `verify-plan-completion` — Cross-references SUMMARY tasks vs PLAN tasks
- `commit-lint` — Validates commit message format against conventional commits
- `check-regression` — Counts Rust/bats tests, flags regressions
- `diff-against-plan` — Compares declared files vs actual git changes
- `validate-requirements` — Checks must_haves against evidence in code/SUMMARYs

### New Gates
- **Review gate** (Step 2b in execute-protocol) — Reviewer critiques plans before Dev team creation
- **QA gate** (Step 3d in execute-protocol) — QA verifies delivery after all Dev tasks complete
- Both gates configurable: `always`, `on_request`, `never`

### Infrastructure
- 3-tier compiled context: researcher/reviewer in "planning" family, QA in "execution" family
- Tier 3 volatile context now includes RESEARCH.md injection
- Markdown minification in tier_context.rs
- Updated model-profiles.json and hooks.json for all 8 agents
```

**Verification:** `head -5 CHANGELOG.md` shows v2.6.0.

### Task 3: Run all tests and verify passing

**Actions (verification only, no file changes):**

1. Run Rust tests: `cargo test -p yolo-mcp-server 2>&1 | tail -5`
   - Expected: 1000+ passed (2 pre-existing failures in dispatcher tests are known)
2. Run bats QA tests: `bats tests/qa-commands.bats`
   - Expected: 5/5 pass
3. Run bats review tests: `bats tests/review-plan.bats`
   - Expected: all pass
4. Run bats tier-cache tests: `bats tests/tier-cache.bats`
   - Expected: all pass

If any NEW test failures (not the 2 pre-existing dispatcher ones), investigate and fix before committing.

**Verification:** Test output shows all expected tests passing.

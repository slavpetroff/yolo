{"plan":"03-02","task":"T1","sev":"nit","finding":"review-ownership-patterns.md Per-Role Templates table lists 'QA Lead' and 'QA Code' which are informal names; the matrix below uses 'yolo-qa' and 'yolo-qa-code'. Naming is consistent enough but could align exactly.","fix":"Consider standardizing table to use 'QA (yolo-qa)' format for discoverability. Non-blocking."}
{"plan":"03-01","task":"T4","sev":"nit","finding":"audit-checklist.md uses unchecked boxes [ ] for items that are targets for Phase 3. After Phase 3 completion, the stale-reference item was updated to [x] but remaining items that were addressed by 03-02/03-03/03-04 are still [ ]. The checklist represents target state (run after any phase) so this is by design, but could confuse readers.","fix":"Add a note at top: 'Items checked off reflect completed work. Unchecked items indicate ongoing verification targets.' Non-blocking."}
{"plan":"03-03","task":"T2","sev":"nit","finding":"execute-protocol.md Change Management section says 'See @references/company-hierarchy.md ## Code Review Chain' but the actual section heading in company-hierarchy.md is '### Code Review Chain' (h3 not h2). The @ reference works regardless but the ## notation implies an h2.","fix":"Change to 'See @references/company-hierarchy.md ### Code Review Chain' for precision. Non-blocking."}
{"plan":"03-04","task":"T2","sev":"nit","finding":"cross-team-protocol.md Status Reporting section references 'dept-status.sh (called by department Lead)' but this script does not yet exist. It is documented as a future implementation detail consistent with the existing dept-gate.sh pattern.","fix":"Add a comment '(Phase 4 implementation)' after the dept-status.sh reference for clarity. Non-blocking."}

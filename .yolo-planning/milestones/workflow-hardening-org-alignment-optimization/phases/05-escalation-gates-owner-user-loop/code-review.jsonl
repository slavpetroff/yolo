D1 (Owner read-only proxy) and D2 (Architect no AskUserQuestion) are explicitly documented and enforced. Schemas, config, upward path, downward path, timeout script, and tests all match architecture.toon specifications. 14 integration tests and 36 containment tests (including 6 new) all pass. check-escalation-timeout.sh is executable, uses set -euo pipefail + jq, returns structured JSON. Codebase mapping (ARCHITECTURE.md, INDEX.md, CONCERNS.md, PATTERNS.md) updated with correct cross-references and counts."}

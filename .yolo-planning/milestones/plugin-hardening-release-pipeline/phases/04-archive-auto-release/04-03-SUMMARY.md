# Summary: archive skill release step update

## What Was Built

Updated archive skill instructions to document the new gh-release step from release-suite. Step 8b now lists gh-release in the steps array and display output. Step 11 includes release URL in the presentation when available.

## Files Modified

- `skills/vibe-modes/archive.md` (plugin file) — Added gh-release display line, updated steps list, added release URL to Step 11 presentation

## Deviations

- Plugin files are outside git tracking (in `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`), so no commit hash.

All 36 agents now have manifest entries with appropriate files, artifacts, fields, budget, and includes references."}
{"id":"T2","s":"complete","fm":"Removed dead flags branch_per_milestone and plain_summary from defaults.json (no code paths consume them). Changed complexity_routing.force_analyze_model from opus to balanced. Added po.skip_on_complexity empty array stub. Updated config.md docs."}
{"id":"T3","s":"complete","fm":"Verified analyze (added in T1) and integration-gate entries exist with correct mappings. Verified po, questionary, roadmap entries have correct artifact/field mappings matching agent .md definitions. No changes needed."}
{"id":"T4","s":"complete","fm":"Created tests/static/manifest-completeness.bats with 6 tests: valid JSON, every agent has entry, required keys present, positive budgets, includes resolve to base roles, count >= 36. All pass."}

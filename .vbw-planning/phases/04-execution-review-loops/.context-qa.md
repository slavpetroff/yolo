## Phase 04 QA Context

### Goal
Implement Dev <-> Senior review loop (max 2 rounds). Add Dev suggestions field (sg) to summary.jsonl. Update per-department Tester agents for structured test results. Formalize Scout as shared on-demand research utility callable by any agent. Add escalation.jsonl with scope_boundary tracking.

### Success Criteria
- Dev/Senior review resolves issues within 2 rounds for test scenarios
- Scout spawns on-demand when research_request detected, not spawned otherwise
- Escalation logs show agents only escalating out-of-scope problems
- summary.jsonl sg field populated and reviewed by Senior

## Phase 04 Verification Context

### Goal
Implement Dev <-> Senior review loop (max 2 rounds). Add Dev suggestions field (sg) to summary.jsonl. Update per-department Tester agents. Formalize Scout as shared on-demand research utility callable by any agent.

### Success Criteria
Not available

### Requirements to Verify
No matching requirements found

### Conventions to Check
- [file-structure] Commands are kebab-case .md files in commands/
- [naming] Agents named yolo-{role}.md or yolo-{dept}-{role}.md in agents/
- [naming] Scripts are kebab-case .sh files in scripts/
- [naming] Phase directories follow {NN}-{slug}/ pattern
- [naming] Plan files named {NN-MM}.plan.jsonl, summaries {NN-MM}.summary.jsonl
- [style] Commits follow {type}({scope}): {desc} format, one commit per task
- [style] Stage files individually with git add, never git add . or git add -A
- [style] Shell scripts use set -u minimum, set -euo pipefail for critical scripts
- [tooling] Use jq for all JSON parsing, never grep/sed on JSON
- [patterns] All hooks route through hook-wrapper.sh for graceful degradation
- [patterns] Zero-dependency design: no package.json, npm, or build step
- [tooling] All scripts target bash, not POSIX sh
- [patterns] Plugin cache resolution via ls | sort -V | tail -1, never glob expansion

### Codebase Map Available
Codebase mapping exists in `.vbw-planning/codebase/`. Key files:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `CONCERNS.md`
- `PATTERNS.md`
- `DEPENDENCIES.md`
- `STRUCTURE.md`
- `CONVENTIONS.md`
- `TESTING.md`
- `STACK.md`

Read TESTING.md, CONCERNS.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md first to bootstrap codebase understanding.

# Database Safety Guard

LLMs with Bash access will occasionally run destructive database commands during verification or debugging — `migrate:fresh`, `db:drop`, `TRUNCATE TABLE` — wiping development data without warning. YOLO prevents this with a three-layer defense that works regardless of programming language, framework, or database type.

## How It Works

A PreToolUse hook (`bash-guard.sh`) intercepts **every** Bash command before it reaches the shell. It pattern-matches against a blocklist of known destructive commands and blocks matches with exit code 2 (fail-closed). The command never executes.

This fires on the **tool**, not the agent. Every Bash command from every agent — QA, Dev, Debugger, Lead — passes through the same gate. There is no way around it because Claude Code enforces hooks at the platform level, before the command reaches the shell.

```
Agent wants to run: php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

                    |  Claude Code sees   |

                    +─────────┬──────────+
                              |
                 +────────────v────────────+

                 exit 0       | Pattern match    |
                 (allow)      | against blocklist|
                              +──┬───────────┬──+
                              match       no match
                               |              |
                            exit 2         exit 0
                            (BLOCK)        (allow)
                               |
                    +──────────v───────────+
                    | Agent sees:          |
                    | "Blocked: destructive|
                    |  command detected"   |
                    +──────────────────────+
```

The agent gets an error message explaining why the command was blocked and adapts — typically falling back to read-only queries or the test suite.

## Three Defense Layers

| Layer                         | Type                  | When It Fires                     | Reliability                      |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| `bash-guard.sh`               | PreToolUse hook       | Before every Bash call            | Deterministic (regex match)      |
| Agent prompt rules            | Behavioral guidance   | When agent reads its instructions | Probabilistic (model compliance) |
| `forbidden_commands` contract | PostToolUse hard gate | After Bash execution              | Deterministic but reactive       |

**Layer 1 is the fix.** It blocks destructive commands before they execute, regardless of what the model decides to do. Prompt instructions can't be ignored because the hook runs at the platform level.

**Layer 2 reduces noise.** Every agent with Bash access (QA, Dev, Debugger, Lead) has a `## Database Safety` section in its prompt. QA is told to never modify database state. Dev is told to prefer migration files over direct commands. This reduces how often Layer 1 needs to fire.

**Layer 3 is audit insurance.** Plans can declare `forbidden_commands` in their frontmatter. The hard-gate system checks the event log for violations after execution, providing an audit trail and preventing repeat offenses in the same session.

| **Redis**           | `redis-cli FLUSHALL`, `redis-cli FLUSHDB`                                                                                     |
| **Docker**          | `docker-compose down -v`, `docker volume rm`, `docker system prune --volumes`                                                 |
| **File system**     | `rm *.sqlite3`, `rm *.db`, `rm -rf /var/lib/mysql`                                                                            |

Safe commands pass through unblocked: `php artisan migrate` (forward migration), `rails db:migrate`, `prisma migrate dev`, `docker-compose down` (without `-v`), `php artisan test`, all read-only queries.

## Overrides

When you legitimately need to run destructive commands:

1. **Environment variable** — Start your session with `YOLO_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=1`. The guard checks this first and exits immediately. Zero overhead.

2. **Config toggle** — Set `"bash_guard": false` in `.yolo-planning/config.json` or run `/yolo:config bash_guard false`. Disables the guard for that project entirely.

3. **Run it yourself** — The hook only fires inside Claude Code. Open a separate terminal and run the command directly. The guard protects against agents doing it unsupervised, not against you.

## Extending the Blocklist

Add project-specific patterns to `.yolo-planning/destructive-commands.local.txt`:

```
# Block our custom reset script
scripts/nuke-dev-data\.sh

# Block our ORM's destructive commands
myorm\s+schema:destroy
```

One regex per line, same format as the default `config/destructive-commands.txt`. Local patterns supplement the defaults — they don't replace them.

## Design Decisions

**Fail-closed.** If jq is missing, input is unparseable, or anything unexpected happens, the guard blocks the command (exit 2). It never fails open.

**Tool-level, not agent-level.** The hook matches on `Bash` tool calls, not on agent identity. Adding a new agent type doesn't create a gap — every Bash call is filtered automatically.

**~50ms overhead.** One jq parse + one grep per Bash call. Negligible compared to the seconds Bash commands typically take. The 5-second timeout in hooks.json provides a safety ceiling.

**Event logging.** Every blocked command is logged to `.yolo-planning/.event-log.jsonl` with command preview (truncated to 40 chars), matched pattern, agent name, and timestamp. Useful for auditing what agents tried to do.

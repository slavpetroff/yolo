# Model Profiles

**Purpose:** Control AI model selection for YOLO agents to optimize cost vs quality tradeoff.

## Overview

YOLO spawns 7 specialized agents (Lead, Dev, QA, Scout, Debugger, Architect, Docs) via the Task tool. Model profiles determine which Claude model each agent uses. Three preset profiles cover common use cases, with per-agent overrides for advanced customization.

## Preset Profiles

### Quality (default)

**Use when:** Architecture decisions, production-critical work, anything embarrassing to get wrong.

| Agent     | Model  | Rationale                                                      |
| --------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lead      | opus   | Maximum planning depth and research quality                    |
| Dev       | opus   | Complex implementation, deep reasoning                         |
| QA        | sonnet | Solid verification without Opus cost                           |
| Scout     | haiku  | Research throughput, 60x cheaper                               |
| Debugger  | opus   | Root cause analysis needs deep reasoning                       |
| Architect | opus   | Roadmap and phase structure requires strategic thinking        |
| Docs      | sonnet | Documentation tasks benefit from clear prose without Opus cost |

**Est. cost per phase:** ~$2.80 (baseline)

### Balanced

**Use when:** Standard development work, most phases.

| Agent     | Model  | Rationale                                   |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Lead      | sonnet | Good planning quality, 5x cheaper than Opus |
| Dev       | sonnet | Solid implementation for most tasks         |
| QA        | sonnet | Standard verification depth                 |
| Scout     | haiku  | Research throughput, cost-effective         |
| Debugger  | sonnet | Good debugging for common issues            |
| Architect | sonnet | Clear roadmaps without Opus overhead        |
| Docs      | sonnet | Standard documentation quality              |

**Est. cost per phase:** ~$1.40 (50% of Quality)

### Budget

**Use when:** Prototyping, exploratory work, tight budget constraints.

| Agent     | Model  | Rationale                                |
| --------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Lead      | sonnet | Minimum viable planning (Haiku too weak) |
| Dev       | sonnet | Maintains code quality baseline          |
| QA        | haiku  | Quick verification, 25x cheaper          |
| Scout     | haiku  | Fast research, minimal cost              |
| Debugger  | sonnet | Root cause needs Sonnet minimum          |
| Architect | sonnet | Roadmap clarity worth Sonnet cost        |
| Docs      | sonnet | Maintains documentation quality baseline |

**Est. cost per phase:** ~$0.70 (25% of Quality, 50% of Balanced)

## Per-Agent Overrides

Override individual agents without switching profiles.

**Syntax (via /yolo:config):**

```
/yolo:config model_override <agent> <model>
```

**Example:**

```
/yolo:config model_override dev opus
```

Sets Dev to Opus while keeping other agents at profile defaults.

**When to override:**

- Dev to Opus on budget profile for complex implementation tasks
- QA to Sonnet on budget profile for critical verification
- Lead to Opus on balanced profile for strategic planning phases

**Clearing overrides:**
Switch to a different profile and back, or manually edit .yolo-planning/config.json.

## Cost Comparison

| Profile  | Lead   | Dev    | QA     | Scout | Docs   | Est. Cost/Phase | vs Quality |
| -------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- | ------ | --------------- | ---------- |
| Quality  | opus   | opus   | sonnet | haiku | sonnet | $2.80           | 100%       |
| Balanced | sonnet | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | sonnet | $1.40           | 50%        |
| Budget   | sonnet | sonnet | haiku  | haiku | sonnet | $0.70           | 25%        |

_Estimates based on typical 3-plan phase with 2 Dev teammates, 1 QA run, Lead planning. Assumes ~15K input + ~5K output tokens per agent turn. Opus ~$15/$75 per MTok, Sonnet ~$3/$15, Haiku ~$0.25/$1.25 (input/output). Actual costs vary by phase complexity and plan count._

## Configuration

**View current profile:**

```
/yolo:config
```

Shows active profile and per-agent model assignments in settings table.

**Switch profile:**

```
/yolo:config model_profile <quality|balanced|budget>
```

Displays before/after cost impact estimate.

**Config file location:**
`.yolo-planning/config.json` -- fields: `model_profile` (string), `model_overrides` (object)

## Implementation Notes

- Model resolution: `yolo resolve-model` reads config, applies profile preset, merges overrides
- Turn-budget resolution: `yolo resolve-turns` reads config `agent_max_turns` and scales by effort. Set a value to `false` or `0` to give that agent unlimited turns (the `maxTurns` parameter is omitted from the Task tool call)
- Task tool integration: All agent-spawning commands pass explicit `model` and `maxTurns` parameters (unless maxTurns resolves to 0, in which case it is omitted)
- Turbo effort bypasses model logic (no agents spawned, direct execution)
- Model names: `opus` = Claude Opus 4.6, `sonnet` = Claude Sonnet 4.5, `haiku` = Claude Haiku 3.5

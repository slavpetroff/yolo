# YOLO Verification Protocol

Authoritative spec for YOLO's verification pipeline. The QA agent is deprecated; Dev natively verifies via MCP testing tools.

## 1. Contexts

- **Post-build:** Auto after `/yolo:vibe` execute mode (unless turbo)

## 2. Three-Tier Verification (VRFY-01)

### Quick (5-10 checks)

- Artifact existence: each `must_haves.artifacts` path exists
- Frontmatter validity: YAML parses, required fields present
- Key string presence: each `contains` value found via grep
- No placeholder text: no `{placeholder}`, `TBD`, `Phase N` stubs

### Standard (15-25 checks)

Quick, plus:

- Content structure: expected sections/headings present
- Key link verification: each `must_haves.key_links` confirmed via grep
- Import/export chain: referenced files exist, cross-refs resolve
- Frontmatter cross-consistency: field values align across related artifacts
- Line count thresholds: files meet minimum size for type
- Convention compliance: check against `CONVENTIONS.md` if it exists (see §5 / VRFY-06)
- Skill-augmented checks: domain-specific checks from installed quality skills

### Deep (30+ checks)

Standard, plus:

- Anti-pattern scan (see §6 / VRFY-07)
- Requirement-to-artifact mapping (see §7 / VRFY-08)
- Cross-file consistency: shared constants/enums/types match everywhere
- Detailed convention verification: every new/modified file checked
- Skill-augmented deep checks: thorough domain-specific verification
- Completeness audit: no partial implementations, no untracked TODO/FIXME

## 3. Auto-Selection Heuristic (VRFY-01)

| Signal                                     | Tier            |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `--effort=turbo`                           | Skipped         |
| `--effort=fast`                            | Quick           |
| `--effort=balanced`                        | Standard        |
| `--effort=thorough`                        | Deep            |
| >15 requirements or last phase before ship | Deep (override) |

Precedence: context overrides > effort-based > default.

## 4. Goal-Backward Methodology (VRFY-02)

Start from desired outcomes, derive testable conditions, verify against artifacts. Catches code that exists but doesn't fulfill its purpose.

1. **State goal:** Extract objective from plan + phase success criteria from ROADMAP.md
2. **Derive truths:** From `must_haves.truths` -- each must be verifiably true in codebase
3. **Verify at three levels:**
   - **Truth checks:** Observable condition per truth. Execute (grep/read/match). PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with evidence
   - **Artifact checks:** File exists at `path`, contains each `contains` string, provides declared capability
   - **Key link checks:** `from` file references `to` file, pattern matches `via`
4. **Classify:** Each check gets PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL with file paths, line numbers, grep output

## 5. Convention Verification (VRFY-06)

Active when `.yolo-planning/codebase/CONVENTIONS.md` exists. Silently skipped otherwise.

| Tier     | Behavior                                                                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Quick    | Skipped                                                                                                      |
| Standard | Spot-check naming patterns + file placement for new files                                                    |
| Deep     | Systematic: every new file vs naming, every modified file vs conventions, code patterns vs documented idioms |

Categories: naming patterns, file placement, import ordering, export patterns.

## 6. Anti-Pattern Scanning (VRFY-07)

| Anti-Pattern                | Detection                                                        | Severity | Tier      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| TODO/FIXME without tracking | `grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME"` not linked to tracker                   | WARN     | Deep      |
| Placeholder text            | `{placeholder}`, `TBD`, `Phase N` stubs, `lorem ipsum`           | FAIL     | Standard+ |
| Empty function bodies       | Functions with no implementation                                 | FAIL     | Deep      |
| Filler phrases              | "think carefully", "be thorough", "as an AI" in agent/ref files  | FAIL     | Standard+ |
| Unwired code                | Exported symbols never imported elsewhere                        | WARN     | Deep      |
| Dead imports                | Imported symbols never used                                      | WARN     | Deep      |
| Hardcoded secrets           | `sk-`, `pk_`, `AKIA`, `ghp_`, `glpat-`, password/secret patterns | FAIL     | Standard+ |

Severities: FAIL = must fix before ship. WARN = review, may be intentional.

Notes: placeholder detection excludes template files; filler detection applies to agent/ref/command files only; secret detection uses pattern matching (known prefixes + common patterns).

## 7. Requirement Mapping (VRFY-08)

Deep tier only. Traces requirement IDs to implementing artifacts.

1. **Extract** requirement IDs from phase section of ROADMAP.md
2. **Trace** each ID to PLAN.md files (must_haves, task descriptions, success criteria) and SUMMARY.md files (accomplishments, commits, files modified)
3. **Classify:** Mapped (plan+summary) = OK. Planned only (plan, no summary) = WARN. Unmapped (neither) = FAIL

Scope: current phase only. Cross-phase requirements noted but not flagged.

## 8. Continuous Verification Hooks (VRFY-03, VRFY-04, VRFY-05)

Protocol instructions in agent definitions (not JS hooks or event handlers).

- **VRFY-03 Post-Write (Dev):** Run linter/type-checker on modified files if configured. Fix before committing. Advisory.
- **VRFY-04 Post-Commit (Dev):** Verify commit format `{type}({scope}): {description}`. Check only task-related files staged. Self-check protocol.
- **VRFY-05 OnStop (Execute):** Verify SUMMARY.md exists with required frontmatter (`phase`, `plan`, `status`, `completed`) and standard sections (Accomplishments, Task Commits, Files Created/Modified, Deviations). Report issues.

## 9. Output Format

### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
phase: { phase-id }
tier: { quick|standard|deep }
result: { PASS|FAIL|PARTIAL }
passed: { N }
failed: { N }
total: { N }
date: { YYYY-MM-DD }
---
```

### Structure

```markdown
# Verification: Phase {N}

## Must-Have Checks

| # | Truth/Condition | Status | Evidence |

## Artifact Checks

| Artifact | Exists | Contains | Status |

## Key Link Checks

| From | To | Via | Status |

## Anti-Pattern Scan (standard+)

| Pattern | Found | Location | Severity |

## Requirement Mapping (deep only)

| Requirement | Plan Ref | Artifact Evidence | Status |

## Convention Compliance (standard+, if CONVENTIONS.md)

| Convention | File | Status | Detail |

## Skill-Augmented Checks (if quality skills)

| Skill | Check | Status | Evidence |

## Summary

Tier: / Result: / Passed: N/total / Failed: [list]
```

Result classification: PASS = all pass (WARNs OK). PARTIAL = some fail but core verified. FAIL = critical checks fail.

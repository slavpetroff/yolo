profile: Turbo (EFRT-04)
model: Sonnet
use_when: Quick fixes, config changes, obvious tasks, low-stakes edits.

effort_vs_model:
  effort_controls: Planning depth, verification thoroughness, research scope (workflow behavior)
  model_controls: Which Claude model each agent uses (cost optimization)
  independent: Can run Thorough effort on Budget profile or Fast effort on Quality profile
  recommendation: Match them (balanced+balanced, thorough+quality, fast+budget)
  config_effort: /yolo:config effort <level> or /yolo:go --effort=<level>
  config_model: /yolo:config model_profile <profile>

matrix:
  Agent|Level|Notes
  Lead|skip|Not spawned. No planning step
  Architect|skip|Not spawned
  Dev|low|Direct execution, no research, minimal change, brief commits
  QA|skip|Not spawned. User judges output directly
  Scout|skip|Not spawned
  Debugger|low|Single hypothesis, targeted fix, minimal report (root cause + fix)

plan_approval (EFRT-07):
  Autonomy|Gate
  All levels|OFF
  note: No lead agent at Turbo; plan approval requires a lead.

effort_mapping:
  Level|Behavior

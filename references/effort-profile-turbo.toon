profile: Turbo (EFRT-04)
model: Sonnet
use_when: Quick fixes, config changes, obvious tasks, low-stakes edits.

effort_vs_model:
  effort_controls: Which workflow steps execute (step skipping). NOT agent quality.
  model_controls: Which Claude model each agent uses (cost optimization)
  independent: Can run Thorough effort on Budget profile or Fast effort on Quality profile
  recommendation: Match them (balanced+balanced, thorough+quality, fast+budget)
  config_effort: /yolo:config effort <level> or /yolo:go --effort=<level>
  config_model: /yolo:config model_profile <profile>
  see: @references/model-profiles.md

agent_quality: full (always). Effort level never degrades agent reasoning or output quality.

step_skips:
  Step|Status|Reason
  1: Critique|SKIP|Low-stakes tasks need no critique
  2: Research (Scout)|SKIP|No research needed for obvious changes
  3: Architecture|run|
  4: Planning|run|
  5: Design Review|run|
  6: Test Authoring (RED)|SKIP|Minimal scope, no formal TDD
  7: Implementation|run|
  8: Code Review|run|
  8.5: Documentation|SKIP|No documentation for quick fixes
  9: QA|SKIP|User judges output directly
  10: Security|SKIP|Low-stakes, no security audit
  11: Sign-off|run|

plan_approval (EFRT-07):
  Autonomy|Gate
  All levels|OFF

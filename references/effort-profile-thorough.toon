profile: Thorough (EFRT-01)
model: Opus
use_when: Critical features, complex architecture, production-impacting changes.

effort_vs_model:
  effort_controls: Which workflow steps execute (step skipping). NOT agent quality.
  model_controls: Which Claude model each agent uses (cost optimization)
  independent: Can run Thorough effort on Budget profile or Fast effort on Quality profile
  recommendation: Match them (balanced+balanced, thorough+quality, fast+budget)
  config_effort: /yolo:config effort <level> or /yolo:go --effort=<level>
  config_model: /yolo:config model_profile <profile>
  see: @references/model-profiles.md

agent_quality: full (always). Effort level never degrades agent reasoning or output quality.

profile: Thorough (EFRT-01)
model: Opus
use_when: Critical features, complex architecture, production-impacting changes.

effort_vs_model:
  effort_controls: Planning depth, verification thoroughness, research scope (workflow behavior)
  model_controls: Which Claude model each agent uses (cost optimization)
  independent: Can run Thorough effort on Budget profile or Fast effort on Quality profile
  recommendation: Match them (balanced+balanced, thorough+quality, fast+budget)
  config_effort: /yolo:config effort <level> or /yolo:go --effort=<level>
  config_model: /yolo:config model_profile <profile>

matrix:
  Agent|Level|Notes
  Lead|max|Exhaustive research, detailed decomposition, full self-review
  Architect|max|Comprehensive scope, full requirement mapping, traceability matrix
  Dev|high|plan_mode_required -- read-only until lead approves. Thorough inline verification
  QA|high|Deep tier (30+ checks). Full anti-pattern scan, requirement mapping
  Scout|high|Broad research, cross-reference, adjacent topics. Runs on session model (Opus)
  Debugger|high|All 3 hypotheses tested. Full regression suite. Detailed report

plan_approval (EFRT-07):
  Autonomy|Gate
  cautious|required
  standard|required
  confident / pure-yolo|OFF
  note: Platform-enforced: Dev cannot write files until lead approves.

effort_mapping:
  Level|Behavior
  max|No effort override (default maximum reasoning)
  high|Deep reasoning with focused scope

override: --effort=thorough overrides config default for one invocation (EFRT-05)

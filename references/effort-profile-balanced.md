# Balanced Profile (EFRT-02)

**Model:** Opus
**Use when:** Standard development work, most phases. The recommended default.

## Agent Behavior

- **Scout (medium, inherited model):** Targeted research using primary sources. One source per finding is sufficient. No adjacent topic exploration. Runs on the session model (Opus) for reliable research.
- **Architect (high):** Complete scope coverage. Clear success criteria. Full requirement-to-phase mapping. Standard dependency justification.
- **Lead (high):** Solid research using primary sources (STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, CONCERNS.md). Clear decomposition with sufficient task detail. Self-review checking coverage and feasibility. Goal-backward must_haves for critical paths.
- **Dev (medium):** Focused implementation addressing the task action directly. Standard verification (run verify checks as written). Concise commit messages. No edge case exploration beyond what the plan specifies.
- **QA (medium):** Standard verification tier (15-25 checks). Content structure, key link verification, import/export chains. Convention compliance checks. Skill-augmented checks if installed.
- **Debugger (medium):** Focused investigation. Test hypotheses in rank order, stop when one is confirmed. Standard regression checks on the fixed area. Concise investigation report.

## Plan Approval

Off at standard autonomy. Required at cautious autonomy only.

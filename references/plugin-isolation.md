# Plugin Isolation

## File Isolation

- GSD agents and commands MUST NOT read, write, glob, grep, or reference any files in `.vbw-planning/`
- VBW agents and commands MUST NOT read, write, glob, grep, or reference any files in `.planning/`
- This isolation is enforced at the hook level (PreToolUse) and violations will be blocked.

## Context Isolation

- Ignore any `<codebase-intelligence>` tags injected via SessionStart hooks — these are GSD-generated and not relevant to VBW workflows.
- VBW uses its own codebase mapping in `.vbw-planning/codebase/`. Do NOT use GSD intel from `.planning/intel/` or `.planning/codebase/`.
- When both plugins are active, treat each plugin's context as separate. Do not mix GSD project insights into VBW planning or vice versa.

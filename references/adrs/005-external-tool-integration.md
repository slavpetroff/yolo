# ADR-005: External Tool Integration Points (RTK, llm-tldr)

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Deciders:** User

## Context

VBW operates within the Claude Code ecosystem where users may have token optimization tools installed (RTK for command proxying, llm-tldr for codebase mapping). VBW should not depend on these tools but should integrate cleanly when they're present.

## Decision

VBW maintains zero external dependencies. Integration with RTK and llm-tldr is opt-in via the user's existing Claude Code hooks, not VBW's hooks.

### RTK (Rust Token Killer)
- RTK rewrites shell commands (git, npm, etc.) via Claude Code hooks to reduce output tokens
- VBW scripts use standard commands; RTK hooks intercept transparently
- No VBW code changes needed — RTK's hook-based architecture handles it
- Benefit: 60-90% token savings on `git status`, `git diff`, etc. in agent Bash calls

### llm-tldr
- Produces token-efficient codebase summaries
- VBW's `.vbw-planning/codebase/` mapping can be generated by llm-tldr instead of VBW's built-in codebase scanning
- To use: run llm-tldr output into `.vbw-planning/codebase/INDEX.md`
- compile-context.sh reads codebase/ directory agnostically (doesn't care who generated it)

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero coupling: VBW works with or without these tools
- Users with RTK get automatic token savings in all VBW agent operations
- llm-tldr users get richer codebase context for Architect and Senior

**Negative:**
- No automated detection/configuration of these tools
- Users must set up RTK/llm-tldr separately

**Neutral:**
- VBW's own codebase mapping remains the default

profile: Balanced (EFRT-02)
model: Opus
use_when: Standard dev work, most phases. Recommended default.

effort_vs_model:
  effort_controls: Planning depth, verification thoroughness, research scope (workflow behavior)
  model_controls: Which Claude model each agent uses (cost optimization)
  independent: Can run Thorough effort on Budget profile or Fast effort on Quality profile
  recommendation: Match them (balanced+balanced, thorough+quality, fast+budget)
  config_effort: /yolo:config effort <level> or /yolo:go --effort=<level>
  config_model: /yolo:config model_profile <profile>
  see: @references/model-profiles.md

matrix:
  Agent|Level|Notes
  Lead|high|Solid research, clear decomposition, coverage+feasibility self-review
  Architect|high|Complete scope, clear criteria, standard dependency justification
  Dev|medium|Focused implementation, standard verification, concise commits
  QA|medium|Standard tier (15-25 checks). Content structure, key links, conventions
  Scout|medium|Targeted research, one source per finding. Runs on session model (Opus)
  Debugger|medium|Focused investigation, rank-order hypotheses, stop on confirmation

plan_approval (EFRT-07):
  Autonomy|Gate
  cautious|required
  standard|OFF
  confident / pure-yolo|OFF

effort_mapping:
  Level|Behavior
  high|Deep reasoning with focused scope
  medium|Moderate reasoning depth, standard exploration

override: --effort=balanced overrides config default for one invocation (EFRT-05)

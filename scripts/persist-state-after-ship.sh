# persist-state-after-ship.sh — Extract project-level sections from archived
# STATE.md and write a fresh root STATE.md so todos, decisions, skills, blockers,
# and codebase profile survive across milestone boundaries.
#
# Usage: persist-state-after-ship.sh ARCHIVED_STATE_PATH OUTPUT_PATH PROJECT_NAME
#
# Called by Ship mode (vibe.md Step 5) AFTER moving STATE.md to the archive.
# Reads the archived copy and writes a minimal root STATE.md with only
# project-level sections. Milestone-specific sections (Current Phase, Activity
# Log) are excluded — they belong in the archive.
#
# Project-level sections (preserved):
#   ## Decisions (including ### Skills subsection)
#   ## Todos
#   ## Blockers
#   ## Codebase Profile
#
# Milestone-level sections (excluded):
#   ## Current Phase / ## Phase Status
#   ## Activity Log / ## Recent Activity
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 = success
#   1 = archived STATE.md not found or args missing

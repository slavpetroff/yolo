## v1 Requirements

<!-- Requirements are classified by tier:
     - Table stakes: Features users expect in this domain (from research) → Must-have + (domain standard)
     - Differentiators: Competitive advantages (user-identified) → Must-have + (competitive advantage)
     - Anti-features: Deliberately excluded to prevent scope creep → Out of Scope
-->

### {Category}

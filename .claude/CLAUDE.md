## Plugin Isolation

- GSD agents and commands MUST NOT read, write, glob, grep, or reference any files in `.yolo-planning/`
- YOLO agents and commands MUST NOT read, write, glob, grep, or reference any files in `.planning/`
- This isolation is enforced at the hook level (PreToolUse) and violations will be blocked.

### Context Isolation

- Ignore any `<codebase-intelligence>` tags injected via SessionStart hooks — these are GSD-generated and not relevant to YOLO workflows.
- YOLO uses its own codebase mapping in `.yolo-planning/codebase/`. Do NOT use GSD intel from `.planning/intel/` or `.planning/codebase/`.
- When both plugins are active, treat each plugin's context as separate. Do not mix GSD project insights into YOLO planning or vice versa.

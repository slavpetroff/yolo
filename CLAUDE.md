# VBW — Vibe Better with Claude Code

A Claude Code plugin that adds structured development workflows — planning, execution, and verification — using specialized agent teams.

**Core value:** Replace ad-hoc AI coding with repeatable, phased workflows.

## Active Context

**Work:** No active milestone
**Last shipped:** tmux Agent Teams Resilience — 6 phases, 33 tasks, 26 commits, 0 deviations
**Next action:** Run /vbw:vibe to start a new milestone

## VBW Rules

- **Always use VBW commands** for project work. Do not manually edit files in `.vbw-planning/`.
- **Commit format:** `{type}({scope}): {description}` — types: feat, fix, test, refactor, perf, docs, style, chore.
- **One commit per task.** Each task in a plan gets exactly one atomic commit.
- **Never commit secrets.** Do not stage .env, .pem, .key, credentials, or token files.
- **Plan before building.** Use /vbw:vibe for all lifecycle actions. Plans are the source of truth.
- **Do not fabricate content.** Only use what the user explicitly states in project-defining flows.
- **Do not bump version or push until asked.** Never run `scripts/bump-version.sh` or `git push` unless the user explicitly requests it, except when `.vbw-planning/config.json` intentionally sets `auto_push` to `always` or `after_phase`.
- **NEVER take work from open or draft PRs.** Before starting any feature, fix, or refactor, run `gh pr list --state open` and check if any open/draft PR already touches the same area. If a PR exists that overlaps with what you're about to do — even if it's draft, half-finished, or failing CI — STOP and tell the user: "There's an open PR (#M) by @author that overlaps with this work. Proceed anyway?" Do NOT read the PR's diff, copy its approach, or integrate its changes without explicit user approval. Contributors' in-progress work belongs to them. This also applies when resolving GitHub issues — check `gh pr list --search "issue_number"` first.
- **Review PRs by diffing against the repo, not just checking overlap.** When reviewing a PR, run `gh pr diff N` and compare the actual changes to what's currently in the repo. A PR that touches files you already modified is NOT automatically redundant — it may contain additional improvements, bug fixes, or edge cases beyond what's already shipped. Only the diff tells you what's new. Don't dismiss a PR as "already done" without confirming every change in the diff is already present in the codebase.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Date | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|

## Installed Skills

_(Run /vbw:skills to list)_

## Project Conventions

_(To be defined during project setup)_

## Commands

Run /vbw:status for current progress.
Run /vbw:help for all available commands.
## Plugin Isolation

- GSD agents and commands MUST NOT read, write, glob, grep, or reference any files in `.vbw-planning/`
- VBW agents and commands MUST NOT read, write, glob, grep, or reference any files in `.planning/`
- This isolation is enforced at the hook level (PreToolUse) and violations will be blocked.

### Context Isolation

- Ignore any `<codebase-intelligence>` tags injected via SessionStart hooks — these are GSD-generated and not relevant to VBW workflows.
- VBW uses its own codebase mapping in `.vbw-planning/codebase/`. Do NOT use GSD intel from `.planning/intel/` or `.planning/codebase/`.
- When both plugins are active, treat each plugin's context as separate. Do not mix GSD project insights into VBW planning or vice versa.

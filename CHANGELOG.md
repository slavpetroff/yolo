# Changelog

All notable changes to VBW will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.25] - 2026-02-07

### Changed

- `/vbw:config` now offers interactive selection for common settings (effort, verification tier, max tasks, agent teams) when called without arguments. Direct `<setting> <value>` syntax still works for power users.

## [1.0.24] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- `/vbw:whats-new` now shows the current version's changelog when called without arguments (was showing nothing because it looked for entries newer than current)
- Agent activity indicator moved to Line 4 inline before GitHub link

## [1.0.23] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Agent activity indicator in statusline Line 5: shows "N agents working" when background agents are active (process-based detection, 3s cache)
- Brownfield auto-map: `/vbw:init` now auto-triggers `/vbw:map` when existing codebase detected instead of just suggesting it

### Fixed

- Statusline "Branch: Phase complete}" corruption: removed unused `Status` field from STATE.md parsing that broke pipe-delimited cache format
- Security filter hook errors: fail-open on malformed input, missing jq, or empty stdin instead of crashing
- Sandbox permission errors in `/vbw:whats-new` and `/vbw:update`: removed `cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/VERSION` from context blocks (plugin root is outside working directory sandbox)
- Stale version in `/vbw:update` whats-new suggestion: removed version argument entirely

## [1.0.20] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Real-time statusline dashboard: context window bar, API usage limits (session/weekly/sonnet/extra), cost tracking, clickable GitHub link, agent team status
- Manifesto section and Discord invite in README
- Statusline screenshot showcase in README Features section

### Changed

- Renamed `/vbw:build` to `/vbw:execute` to avoid security filter collision with `build/` pattern
- Moved directory scaffold into Step 0 of `/vbw:init` so all setup completes before user questions
- Versioned cache filenames in statusline -- auto-clears stale caches on plugin update
- Simplified `/vbw:whats-new` to read directly from plugin root instead of cache paths (fixes sandbox permission errors)
- Improved `/vbw:update` messaging to clarify "since" version in whats-new suggestion

### Fixed

- Security filter no longer blocks `skills/build/SKILL.md` (resolved by rename to `skills/execute/`)
- Usage limits API: added required `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` header
- Extra usage credits display: correctly converts cents to dollars
- Statusline `utilization` field: removed erroneous x100 (API returns 0-100, not 0-1)
- Weekly countdown now shows days when >= 24 hours
- Removed hardcoded `/vbw:plan 1` references (auto-detection handles phase selection)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added

- Complete agent system: Scout, Architect, Lead, Dev, QA, Debugger with tool permissions and effort profiles
- Full command suite: 25 commands covering lifecycle, monitoring, supporting, and advanced operations

- Skills integration: stack detection, skill discovery, auto-install suggestions, agent skill awareness
- Concurrent milestones with isolated state, switching, shipping, and phase management
- Persistent memory: CLAUDE.md generation, pattern learning, session pause/resume
- Resilience: three-tier verification pipeline, failure recovery, intra-plan resume, observability
- Version management: /vbw:whats-new changelog viewer, /vbw:update plugin updater
- Effort profiles: Thorough, Balanced, Fast, Turbo controlling agent behavior
- Deviation handling: auto-fix minor, auto-add critical, auto-resolve blocking, checkpoint architectural

### Changed
